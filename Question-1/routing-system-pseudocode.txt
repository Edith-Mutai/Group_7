A hashmap containing maintenance schedules
A list containing event routes

Steps
1. Create lists and hashmaps containing the busesâ€™ and trains' base schedules, maintenance, routes usually taken during events, and the current hour.

2. If the current hour falls within the peak hours, add the required number of buses or trains to that route

3. If the route that the bus or train is using is an event route, add the required number of buses or trains to that route

4. If the bus or train is on a route where buses and trains are required for maintenance, reduce the number of buses or trains on that route that need to go for maintenance. 

5. Create an empty hashmap that will contain the new schedule for the buses' and trains' new routes

Output
New schedules of the trains and buses
